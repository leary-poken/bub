# Bub: Socialized Evaluation and Agent Partnership

I care less about whether an agent can complete a demo task, and more about whether a real team can trust it under pressure.
That is where most systems fail: not at capability, but at collaboration.

Bub is not designed as a personal-only assistant.
It is designed for shared environments where humans and agents are treated as equivalent operators.
Current deployments may use one primary agent, but the collaboration model itself is symmetric: the same boundaries, evidence model, and handoff semantics apply to both humans and agents.

The practical goal is simple: when work gets messy, Bub should still feel like a dependable teammate.
It should make execution visible, handoff safe, and continuation predictable.

## From Tool Execution to Human Partnership

Many agent systems focus on whether a model can execute commands.
For real teams, that is not enough.
What matters is whether outcomes remain understandable, reviewable, and improvable over long time horizons.

Bub treats this as a first-class design target:

- Agents should assist human workflows, not replace human judgment.
- Operator decisions, agent actions, and execution evidence should stay visible.
- Collaboration should remain stable when more operators and automation layers join.

## Socialized Evaluation as a System Principle

In Bub, evaluation is not only model-centric.
It is social by design:

- Can teammates inspect what happened and why?
- Can reviewers audit decisions without hidden state?
- Can future operators continue work from recorded evidence?
- Can all operators (human or agent) coordinate without opaque side effects?

If the answer is no, the system is not reliable enough for production collaboration.
The term "Socialized Evaluation" follows the framing in [Instant Messaging and Socialized Evaluation](https://psiace.me/posts/im-and-socialized-evaluation/).

## Why Operator Equivalence by Default

Single-user flows can hide many structural problems.
Multi-operator settings expose them quickly: state conflicts, unclear responsibility, and fragile context boundaries.

Bub is built with these constraints from day one:

- Explicit command boundaries.
- Verifiable execution history with explicit anchor and handoff points.
- Handoff and anchors for continuity across people and phases.
- Channel/runtime neutrality for different operation surfaces.

This is how Bub moves from "assistant behavior" to "collaboration infrastructure."

## Relationship to Republic

Bub uses [Republic](https://github.com/bubbuild/republic) as its context runtime.
Republic's key value is not "a better memory trick." It reframes the problem: keep interaction history as verifiable facts, then assemble minimally sufficient context for each task.
Bub builds on that model to support practical collaboration workflows where humans and agents participate as equivalent operators.

## Closing

Our direction is simple:

Build agents that are useful in real social systems, not only impressive in isolated demos.
